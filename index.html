    <h1 class="h1">All About Meya</h1>
    <p> I'm Meya, a George Westinghouse Scholar with a strong passion for computer science. My love for coding began in middle school when I was introduced to programming languages in my tech class. A turning point came when I witnessed a robot in the FIRST Robotics Championship capable of having full conversations, which deepened my interest in coding and artificial intelligence. Since then, I've been actively involved in my school's robotics team, constantly striving to improve my coding skills and push myself toward excellence. I really love coding and debugging as it is a favorite hobby of mine. Additionally, my dream career is to be a software engineer. It will be a long journey ahead of me, however I am capable.

    <p>Demon Slayer is the first anime I've watched, and it has quickly become my favorite. The plot is captivating, and the characters' personalities are exceptionally well-developed. My favorite character is Inosuke, as he resonates with me the most. Inosuke is wild, aggressive, and prideful, yet he is also incredibly determined. His confidence and self-esteem are unwavering, and his egotism fuels his constant desire for challenges. I identify with him because, like Inosuke, I thrive on challenges and view myself as superior to others. </p>

    <p>Badminton has always held a special place in my heart. Ever since physical education introduced me to Badminton, I've practiced in my own time and also that is the main sport I play during gym with friends. I love the feeling I get when I am hitting the birdie also known as the shuttlecock to the opposing side. I like how simple the game is yet, we need to hit it hard for it to go far with enough strength. I'm a competitive person, and it's always a problem when I lose in badminton. Ha, fooled you I never lose because I'm the best player when it comes to playing Badminton with others.</p>
